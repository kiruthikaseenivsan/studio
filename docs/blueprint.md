## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated blue (#4285F4) to evoke trust and intelligence, as commonly associated with data and analytics.
- Background color: Light, desaturated blue (#E3F2FD), maintaining a connection to the primary color without overpowering the interface.
- Accent color: Analogous cyan (#00BCD4), providing contrast and highlighting interactive elements like buttons and active data points on graphs.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, will be used for all text elements for its modern, objective, neutral look, suiting both headlines and body text.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent data types, categories, and actions within the app.
- Emphasize a clean, data-centric layout. Prioritize the visualization of analytics and user tools above all else.
- Subtle animations will smoothly update data displays, bringing the interface to life while avoiding distraction. Focus will be on smooth transitions and updates on charts and data points.
